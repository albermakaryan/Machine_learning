# Machine_learning Final Project
1. EDA (In this part we will use for PERIOD==3)
2. Feature Selection (in this part we will create a desicion tree for various features and select features which show correlation from our target variable)
3. Data Preparation and Modelling
   a. imputation(in this we will impute using K-NN imputer)
   b. Balancing in this we will balance our output since it is highly imbalance
   c. modelling (try various model and check accuracy)
4. Check for accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall
